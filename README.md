###The 2016 Texas Primary

This repo is dedicated toward examining the data from the 2016 Texas Presidential Primary. Most of the code in `TexasPrimary2016.R` comes from [this post on R-Bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/mapping-election-results-with-r-and-choroplethr/) (by way of [R. Duncan McIntosh](http://rduncanmcintosh.com/) and his [post on Ari Lamstein's blog](http://www.arilamstein.com/blog/2016/03/21/mapping-election-results-r-choroplethr/))  
You will need to run the `TexasPrimary2016.R` script to run the examples in `examples.R`.
